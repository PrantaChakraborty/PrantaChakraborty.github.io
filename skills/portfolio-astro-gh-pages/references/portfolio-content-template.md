# Portfolio Content Template

Use this structure to convert resume details into concise portfolio content.
Keep website content short; keep full detail in `public/resume.pdf`.

## Hero

- Name
- Title: Backend Software Engineer
- One-line positioning statement focused on impact
- Primary CTA: `View Projects`
- Secondary CTA: `Download Resume`

Example pattern:
`Backend engineer focused on reliable APIs, distributed systems, and performance optimization at scale.`

## Projects

For each project:

- Name + short subtitle
- Problem
- Solution architecture
- Tech stack
- Impact/result
- Optional links (GitHub/demo)

Guidelines:

- Keep concise (2 strong cards is enough)
- Avoid copying every resume bullet
- Keep measurable outcomes where available

## Skills Banner / Logo Row

Use a lightweight logo row or concise tech highlights near hero.
Do not add large skill dumps in project cards unless explicitly requested.

## Contact

Match sample-style layout:

- Left: short invite text and location/email
- Right: form (`Name`, `Email`, `Message`) + submit button
- Optional success confirmation

## Resume PDF

- Save file to `public/resume.pdf`
- Keep one clear hero button for download
- Use `download` attribute
