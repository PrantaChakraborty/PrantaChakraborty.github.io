### How to use skills

- Discovery: Skills available in this project are listed above with path to `SKILL.md`.
- Trigger rules: If the user mentions the skill name (with `$portfolio-astro-gh-pages` or plain text) or asks to build/update portfolio sections, design, contact form, resume download, or GitHub Pages deploy config, use this skill.
- Progressive loading:
  1. Open the skill `SKILL.md` and follow its workflow.
  2. Load only referenced files needed for the task.
  3. Reuse template guidance from `references/` instead of rewriting structure each turn.
- Fallback: If skill files are missing or unreadable, continue with best-effort implementation and report the issue briefly.
